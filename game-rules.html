<p class="rules-para">If don't know how the game works this is a right Left click 
 Before Starting about how the game works I would appreciate that you gave your
 precious time to this So , Thank You .  </p>

 <p class="rules-para">*First of all you need to do is
 have your speaker at it's max output or full sound else you can put your earphones
on . *</p>

<p class="rules-para">
  The working of game is very simple , firstly , you would be given a sound and a blink
  at one of the tiles , then , you have to tap that tile , then , you would be given
  another blink on another tile . Now , a very important step , you have heard the
  tile you have to tap the tile which you heard first and then you have to tap next
  tile that you heard .
</p>

<p class="rules-para">Basically What I'm trying to say is that you need to remember
the blinking of the tiles and then tap accordingly . This is same as memory game that
we all ave played in which a sequence of words are said and new words are added and again <thead>
  player says the sequence with a new word added .
</thead></p>
